This is a project that never made it to launch. 
The intention was to have a token that would generate money for you if you held certain NFTs.
The NFTs belong to 5 specific play to earn games. The rewards were calculated based on the amount of activity you had inside those games.
I was in charge of making the front end. 
This was made using ReactJs, Moralis and ethersjs.
